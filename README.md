## 🔧 Installation

### Prerequisites

-FastAPI: For building the backend server.
-WebSocket: For real-time, bidirectional communication.
-HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For the frontend.
-Python: Core programming language.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ¿¿¿bash
    git clone https://github.com/tarun1030/AI-CONCEPT-QUIZ-SYSTEM.git
    cd ai-websocket-feedback
    ¿¿¿

2. Install dependencies:
    ¿¿¿bash
    npm install
    ¿¿¿

3. Start the mock WebSocket server:
    ¿¿¿bash
    npm run mock-server
    ¿¿¿

4. Configure the connection to the WebSocket server by updating config/websocket.js:
    javascript
    module.exports = {
        serverUrl: "wss://your-websocket-server.com",
        secure: true
    };
    

5. Run the application:
    ¿¿¿bash
    npm start
    ¿¿¿

## 🚀 Usage

1. *Starting the WebSocket Server*: Use the provided npm run mock-server to initiate a local server for testing.
2. *Real-time Scoring*: Connect your application to the WebSocket server and send AI-related questions to analyze.
3. *Customization*: Modify scoring logic and prompts in the src/logic folder to suit specific use cases.

## 🏗 System Architecture

### Overview
- *WebSocket Server*: Handles incoming connections and dispatches prompts/responses.
- *AI Response Processor*: Analyzes user responses and applies scoring logic.
- *Cache Layer*: Optimizes response times using in-memory caching.
- *Error Handler*: Manages edge cases like invalid inputs and network issues.
